# high-school-code
This is my code from high school. It's terrible. Please don't judge me based on how awful it is. I'm really a better programer now than I was back then.

Everything is written in .Net.

**original-code** - The original code from high school untouched in all it's glory. Many of the projects will build and run just fine, however this code was written well over a decade ago and may not run on a modern system.

**remasters** - I updated the largest projects and updated them so they could compile and run on a modern system at a modern resolution. I made as few changes as possible so all the terrible logic is still there, but I changed the resolution, embeded the assets into the executable, and removed the old direct x calls. I compiled them as portable, static binaries that you can download on the [release](https://github.com/fuele/high-school-code/releases/tag/v1.0) page.
