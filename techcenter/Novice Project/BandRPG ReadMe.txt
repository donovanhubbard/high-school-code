Welcome and thank you for playing Band RPG, the text based adventure 
game based on actual events, (for the most part). If you are familar with 
Text-Based-Adventures then this game will come easily to you. If not you should 
read on.



How the game works:

You will be informed where you are and what is around you. Then you will type in 
a command and it will go from there. Example "look" or "help."

Commands:

"look" looks around the room and tells you what's in it
"look object" looks at the specific object
"help" Not very helpful
"inv"  Displays your inventory
"talk person" talks with the person you typed in
"take object" Takes an object that you typed in
"give object" gives the specified object to someone

Those are the major commands. There are a few others that may need to be used 
but use your head. Example "open door"


Object of the Game:

You just need to do everything, remember that this is based on inside jokes from 
band. You can keep track of your score by talking to Mr. Brunson.


If you get stuck in the game:

Don't miss little details. Try looking at objects, taking objects, looking 
around, and especially talking to people.

You can also go to the practice room and talk to Beau Shaw, he'll give you 
random advice.


Good Luck and have fun!
